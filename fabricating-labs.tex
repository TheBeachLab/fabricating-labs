\section{Introduction}
Are you planning to set up a Fab Lab or Makerspace? A common mistake is starting by placing machines and then figuring out the rest later. But did you think about the workflow around each machine? Are the other uses inside that room compatible with your process?  This Guide is intended to help identifying those workflows, cover the basic requirements and to avoid having future problems related to inadequate planning.\\

As a member of a global network of interconnected labs, I have had the opportunity to
visit, set up, fix and operate many fab labs all around the world, including mine, The Beach Lab. I not
only help fab labs to streamline the setup, operation and training of their facilities. I also
guide them to create better spaces that are not just rooms with a bunch of equipment, but
promote the development of a strong sharing community and interaction of its members.


\section{The Ideal Layout}
Many times I receive this question: \textit{What is the ideal Fab Lab layout?}
\subsection{The short answer} 
It does not exist such a thing.

\subsection{The long answer}
There is not and ideal layout for a Fab Lab. Every fab lab has its owns singularities that make
them unique spaces. But what makes all fab labs so great orbits around a very simple idea that
is represented in the three men holding each one shoulder in Fab Lab logo. Fab Labs are
places to learn, to make and to share. 

\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=8cm]{files/learn-make-share} 
\end{figure}

And these three values, should have a representation in the layout. Other desirable values to foster through the layout:
\begin{description}
\item[Flexibility.] The spaces should serve many purposes. A flexible design can virtually multiply
the space in your lab, making it suitable for many different activities. I was glad to see some
furniture and machines on wheels. It also requires incorporating hanging power cords, open
ceilings and flexible ducts for lasers exhausts.
\item[Modularity.] The space should be able to grow or shrink as the needs of the lab progresses.
\item[Sustainability.] This is a key and fundamental concept that it's behind the origin of fab labs.
\item[Sharing and collaboration.] The spaces we create should encourage people to cooperate
together.
\end{description}
 
\section{The Planning Process}
\subsection{Planning Phases}
\begin{description}
\item [Phase 1:] List the capabilities you would like to have in the Fab Lab. Elaborate your inventory according to your budget. This is a important step because you don't want to end up with duplicated equipment, missing equipment/materials, materials of doubtful utility and unbalanced number of machines.

\item [Phase 2:] Analyze the needs of these machines and their hosting spaces in terms of MEP (Mechanical, electrical,plumbing) and HSE (health, safety and environment). Determine which are the rooms that are
more suitable for each type of machine.
\item [Phase 3:] Determine a layout plan for the separation of the spaces.
\item [Phase 4:] Elaborate a plan to implement furniture, MEP and HSE needs.
\item [Phase 5:] Develop and execute the chosen solution.

\end{description}




\subsection{List of requirements to be assessed}
For each of the above levels of assessment we will identify the following requirements:
\begin{description}
\item [Operational Logistics:] How will the assets and people flow in, out and around? How will you manage the inventory (including maintenance, storage and locking requirements)? How will you control access? What's the maintenance plan? Is the facility ready for redundancy and resiliency when some equipment fail?

\item [Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) requirements:] Under this category it is included lighting requirements, HVAC systems, piping and plumbing, power and electrical requirements. Paying special attention to using the natural resources (natural lighting, natural ventilation, etc.) that can lower the environmental footprint of the facility.

\item [Health, Safety and Environment (HSE):] We should take very seriously Health, Safety and Environment aspects in Fab Labs. It's our social responsibility and our legacy to take care of the users, faculty and employees.
The inventory of equipment, materials, workflows and processes that Fab Labs use and recommend have been
carefully selected in order to comply with the highest standards of HSE. This also includes ergonomy and waste management.
\end{description}

\subsection{Levels of assessment}
When planning a Fab Lab, the above requirements should be assessed in 4 levels of detail:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The machine or process}. Each machine and process has its owns requirements.
\item \textbf{The workflow around that machine or process}. A machine it's usually part of a bigger process or workflow, whose requirements you need to analyse too. If workflows
are not identified, machines and materials will be  placed randomly (incorrectly) placed without a
logical arrangement. Ideally every machine and process should follow a logic workflow and
have all its materials, inflows and outflows at reaching distance.

\item \textbf{The room containing that workflow} must be analysed specially looking for incompatibilities regarding noise, dust, ventilation, etc. Not only Learning, making and sharing spaces should be separated. Within the making
area of the lab, there should be separation of clean and quiet with loud and messy areas to avoid incompatible uses colliding.
\item \textbf{The building containing that room} must be assessed as well. High frecuency vibrations created by digital fabrication machines can travel through the structure of the building causing trouble in areas very far areas from its origin.
\end{itemize}

This phase produces virtually zero waste. A dedicated vacuum machine or a clean brush is recommended to pick up all the wax chips for future use.
\item Phase 2 and Phase 3 can be executed in a separate room. These phases require a ventilated area and access to water and a sink.
\item (3) Refer to MSDS for important health and safety information
\item (4) Store reusable molds in the same storage room as silicons
\item (5) Waste: Pots, gloves, sticks, etc, stained with silicons and rubbers
\item (8) Waste: Pots, gloves, sticks, etc, stained with casting materials
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Filtration System}
Most of the time you are going to be working with wood materials. This equipment
produces a loud and dusty environment. So, the first advice is
placing all this equipment in a separated room. Most of these machines come with
a dust collector that will capture the thicker wood particles. But still there will be finer cloud
particles up to 10 micron that will not only float for around 30 minutes, but also will be
suspended again with the slightest movement of air. The fine dust becomes a serious health issue. These
fine particles will come from 2 sources. One is the dust collection felt bag that will allow
particles up to 3 microns to escape through the fabric. And the second source is particles that because their high speed will never enter the dust collection system.\\

So I suggest that you install in these rooms a filtration system rated so that it will cycle through
the entire volume of air in the room 6 to 8 times per hour. And with a timer for 2, 4, or 8 hours
so that when the user will walk out of the room will flip the switch and forget about it.
