\section{Introduction}
Are you planning to set up a Fab Lab or Makerspace? A common mistake is starting by placing machines and then figuring out the rest later. But did you think about the workflow around each machine? Are the other uses inside that room compatible with your process?  This Guide is intended to help identifying those workflows, cover the basic requirements and to avoid having future problems related to inadequate planning.\\

As a member of a global network of interconnected labs, I have had the opportunity to
visit, set up, fix and operate many fab labs all around the world, including mine, The Beach Lab. I not
only help fab labs to streamline the setup, operation and training of their facilities. I also
guide them to create better spaces that are not just rooms with a bunch of equipment, but
promote the development of a strong sharing community and interaction of its members.\\

While this document will need to be further
developed, it will settle the foundations for the work to be elaborated in your planning process.



\section{The Ideal Layout}
Many times I receive this question: \textit{What is the ideal Fab Lab layout?}
\subsection{The short answer} 
It does not exist such a thing.

\subsection{The long answer}
There is not and ideal layout for a Fab Lab. Every fab lab has its owns singularities that make
them unique spaces. But what makes all fab labs so great orbits around a very simple idea that
is represented in the three men holding each one shoulder in Fab Lab logo. \textit{Fab Labs are
places to learn, to make and to share}. 

\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=8cm]{files/learn-make-share} 
\end{figure}

And these three basic concepts, should have a physical representation in the layout. 

\subsection{Values to foster}
Apart from that, there are some key values we will try to embed into the fab lab.
Since these values have a lot to do with innovation:

\begin{description}
\item[Flexibility.] The spaces should serve many purposes. A flexible design can virtually multiply
the space in your lab, making it suitable for many different activities. I was glad to see some
furniture and machines on wheels. It also requires incorporating hanging power cords, open
ceilings and flexible ducts for lasers exhausts.
\item[Modularity.] The space should be able to grow or shrink as the needs of the lab progresses.
\item[Sustainability.] This is a key and fundamental concept that it's behind the origin of fab labs.
\item[Sharing and collaboration.] The spaces we create should encourage people to cooperate
together.
\end{description}

If you want to send a powerful message, you must show and transmit these values through every
aspect in the fab lab, from the workshops, to the layout, to the furniture, to the
materials and to the staff.

electronics that displays the amount of water in the soil using color codes.}
\end{figure}

\section{Learning, making, sharing}
\subsection{The Sharing Space}
The sharing space could be considered as a sort of mixer. It is, by far, the
most important of the 3 spaces
found in fab labs. If we fail to
have a sharing space there will
not be a community to build
around. Ideally it is an open-access, informal space where
people meet and gather
together and interact. In most
places it builds around food
and drink, adopting the form of
a maker cafe, or a shared
kitchen. This space is suitable
for all kind of interactions, and
to showcase projects. And it is
a relaxed environment for new
members of the lab, who can
enter and see what is
happening inside the lab in a
format that is friendly and
known to them. We should
avoid formalisms as corporate
receptions which will not help
in this kind of spaces.

\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom

   \includegraphics[width=16cm]{files/roof} 
   \caption{Natural renewable materials like wood should be prioritized in the design of the fab lab.
In this picture, a Shopbot machine has been used to design a custom organic shapes. In
this kind of lab fabricated environments, it is easy to engage conversations and to
explain the values of prototyping, design and collaborative assembly.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=16cm]{files/sharing2} 
   \caption{The sharing space is a great space to display projects developed in the fab lab. In this
picture \textit{The Beach Lab}. On the left a custom control panel for the lights of the fab lab.
In the center a split flap display to display twitter messages. On the right a collaborative
chalkboard where people can express their creativity. Some other spaces also have
some kind of collaborative walls with lego parts that the members keep filling up. Or white sculptures that people draw with markers.}
\end{figure}




\subsection{The Learning Space}
The design of the
Learning Space can be
envisioned as hybrid
classroom/lab.
This flexible
classlab blend
elements of traditional
classroom and
laboratories to
support the students working
in several disciplines
(biology, mechanics,
electronics, etc.) at the same time. Students in these spaces typically work in
groups of three, collaborating on real world science problems.\\ 

If space allows, it is recommended to dedicate a big central space as auditorium, where all the members can gather to attend
lectures, guest speakers and perform big presentations and announcements. Otherwise, the Sharing Space is where this public activities also fit well.


\subsection{The Making Space}
The Making Space is the kernel of the fab lab, it's \textit{where things happen}. This
space  usually host incompatible uses that make mandatory a division of the making space into 2 areas. The clean and quiet, and the loud and messy. If you can afford it you could organize the 2 areas around \textit{The
Assembler}, which is a central area with multipurpose tables to assemble and work in projects.
The Assembler needs to be very versatile to be able to host very diverse projects, in terms of
people participating and space and resources required. In this main area you could also have specificic shared design resources like a library of books/reading corner, multimedia production hardware for the creation and edition of audio and video content, VR technologies and 3D mouse for increased CAD productivity.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\smartdiagram[bubble diagram]{The\\ Assembler, Loud and\\ Messy, Quiet and\\ Clean}
\end{figure}
The Making Space is where you want to start thinking about access-control. It's not that you forbid or restrict who enters. It's that you should know who enters and whether they have the proper credentials and safety knowledge to operate the equipment. Because this is the area of the fab lab where potentially dangerous equipment is.

\section{The Planning Process}
\subsection{Planning Phases}
\begin{description}
\item [Phase 1:] List the capabilities you would like to have in the Fab Lab. Elaborate your inventory according to your budget. This is a important step because you don't want to end up with duplicated equipment, missing equipment/materials, materials of doubtful utility and unbalanced number of machines.

\item [Phase 2:] Analyze the needs of these machines and their hosting spaces in terms of MEP (Mechanical, electrical,plumbing) and HSE (health, safety and environment). Determine which are the rooms that are
more suitable for each type of machine.
\item [Phase 3:] Determine a layout plan for the separation of the spaces.
\item [Phase 4:] Elaborate a plan to implement furniture, MEP and HSE needs.
\item [Phase 5:] Develop and execute the chosen solution.

\end{description}




\subsection{List of requirements to be assessed}
For each of the above levels of assessment we will identify the following requirements:
\begin{description}
\item [Operational Logistics:] How will the assets and people flow in, out and around? How will you manage the inventory (including maintenance, storage and locking requirements)? How will you control access? What's the maintenance plan? Is the facility ready for redundancy and resiliency when some equipment fail?

\item [Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) requirements:] Under this category it is included lighting requirements, HVAC systems, piping and plumbing, power and electrical requirements. Paying special attention to using the natural resources (natural lighting, natural ventilation, etc.) that can lower the environmental footprint of the facility.

\item [Health, Safety and Environment (HSE):] We should take very seriously Health, Safety and Environment aspects in Fab Labs. It's our social responsibility and our legacy to take care of the users, faculty and employees.
The inventory of equipment, materials, workflows and processes that Fab Labs use and recommend have been
carefully selected in order to comply with the highest standards of HSE. This also includes ergonomy and waste management.
\end{description}

\subsection{Levels of assessment}
When planning a Fab Lab, the above requirements should be assessed in 4 levels of detail:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The machine or process}. Each machine and process has its owns requirements.
\item \textbf{The workflow around that machine or process}. A machine it's usually part of a bigger process or workflow, whose requirements you need to analyse too. If workflows
are not identified, machines and materials will be  placed randomly (incorrectly) placed without a
logical arrangement. Ideally every machine and process should follow a logic workflow and
have all its materials, inflows and outflows at reaching distance.

\item \textbf{The room containing that workflow} must be analysed specially looking for incompatibilities regarding noise, dust, ventilation, etc. Not only Learning, making and sharing spaces should be separated. Within the making
area of the lab, there should be separation of clean and quiet with loud and messy areas to avoid incompatible uses colliding.
\item \textbf{The building containing that room} must be assessed as well. High frecuency vibrations created by digital fabrication machines can travel through the structure of the building causing trouble in areas very far areas from its origin.
\end{itemize}

This phase produces virtually zero waste. A dedicated vacuum machine or a clean brush is recommended to pick up all the wax chips for future use.
\item Phase 2 and Phase 3 can be executed in a separate room. These phases require a ventilated area and access to water and a sink.
\item (3) Refer to MSDS for important health and safety information
\item (4) Store reusable molds in the same storage room as silicons
\item (5) Waste: Pots, gloves, sticks, etc, stained with silicons and rubbers
\item (8) Waste: Pots, gloves, sticks, etc, stained with casting materials

\subsubsection*{Filtration System}
Most of the time you are going to be working with wood materials. This equipment
produces a loud and dusty environment. So, the first advice is
placing all this equipment in a separated room. Most of these machines come with
a dust collector that will capture the thicker wood particles. But still there will be finer cloud
particles up to 10 micron that will not only float for around 30 minutes, but also will be
suspended again with the slightest movement of air. The fine dust becomes a serious health issue. These
fine particles will come from 2 sources. One is the dust collection felt bag that will allow
particles up to 3 microns to escape through the fabric. And the second source is particles that because their high speed will never enter the dust collection system.\\

So I suggest that you install in these rooms a filtration system rated so that it will cycle through
the entire volume of air in the room 6 to 8 times per hour. And with a timer for 2, 4, or 8 hours
so that when the user will walk out of the room will flip the switch and forget about it.

\section{Becoming a Super Lab}
At some point your lab might naturally jump to the next level and provide the community with a unique space
that becomes an international reference. In the network we call it a Super Fab Lab. A
Super Fab Lab it's not just a lab with increased capabilities in terms of space and
machinery. It is also attached to leaders with  deep values and vision, there is much more planning and strategy involved and it is something that
cannot be done in one go. You will need to correct and change things as the
community reacts. Will your lab become one of the
leading labs in the world, the ones that you can enumerate with just one hand, on par
with labs of the level of Barcelona, Amsterdam and Boston? Let's see if you have what it takes.
\subsection{The Champion}
No half-measures here. Either you have it or not. As stated in Fab Foundation page, the Champion is a fundamental human resource for the success of the
venture. It is someone who has the Fab Lab values, the passion for the job and a visionary goal for
the future. If he/she is not within the founder team of the space, bad news ahead. It might take some time to find your Champion, or it might never show up. They might
come from the faculty, students or members. My advice is to try to identify \textit{The One} within your community. If it
ever shows up, make sure you empower him to lead and drive the lab to the next level.

\subsection{Team Diversity}
One of the surprising things about fab labs is that the most beautiful and meaningful projects are never created by engineers. Engineers are weird people, and I can talk first hand here, while fundamental for their technical and organizational skills, need to be complemented by other kind of people. I
recommend that you incorporate a broader set of people, skilled in arts, design and
architecture to better attract, serve and guide the community in their projects.
