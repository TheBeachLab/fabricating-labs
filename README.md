# Fabricating Labs
Are you planning to set up a Fab Lab or Makerspace? A common mistake is starting by placing machines and then figuring out the rest later. But did you think about the workflow around each machine? Are the other uses inside that room compatible with your process?  This Guide is intended to help identifying those workflows, cover the basic requirements and to avoid having future problems related to inadequate planning.

Fabricating Labs is a guide for designing and planning Fab Labs, Makerspaces and innovation facilities. It is a book written in LaTeX by Francisco Sanchez Arroyo and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0).
