# Fabricating Labs
Are you planning to set up a Fab Lab or Makerspace? The most common mistake is starting with the machines and then figuring out the rest later. But did you think about why do you want these machines? What are the challenges that you want to solve with them?  What about the technical and operational aspects? Did you consider the workflows around each machine? Are the other uses inside a room compatible with the new process?

Fabricating Labs is a guide for designing and planning Fab Labs, Makerspaces and innovation facilities. It is a book written in LaTeX by Francisco Sanchez Arroyo and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0).
