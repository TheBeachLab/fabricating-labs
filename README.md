# Designing Sustainable Innovation Spaces

Are you planning to set up a Fab Lab, Makerspace or innovation space? The most common mistake is starting with the machines and then figuring out the rest later. But did you think about why do you want these machines? What are the challenges that you want to solve with them?  What about the technical and operational aspects? Did you consider the workflows around each machine? Are the other uses inside a room compatible with the new process? What about the sustainability aspects of building design and construction? Will your project be eligible for LEED certification? How will you foster an equitable and respectful workplace?

Fabricating Labs is a digital book that will guide you in designing and planning Fab Labs, Makerspaces and innovation facilities.
